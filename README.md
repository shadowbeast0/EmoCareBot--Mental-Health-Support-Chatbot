# EmoCareBot ‚Äì AI-Powered Mental Health Support Chatbot

A conversational AI that listens, understands, and responds with empathy.

---

## Overview

**EmoCareBot** is an NLP-powered mental health chatbot designed to engage with users in moments of emotional distress ‚Äî offering comfort, support, and a safe space to express their feelings.

Using a custom-trained intent recognition model built on a labeled dataset of mental health expressions, the chatbot identifies what the user is going through ‚Äî from sadness and anxiety to relationship issues and feelings of worthlessness ‚Äî and responds with relevant, empathetic messages.

---

## What It Does

- Uses a **deep learning classifier** to recognize **user intent** from emotional language.
- Matches input text to intents like:
  - `"i am sad"`
  - `"i want to quit"`
  - `"i lost someone"`
  - `"i'm being bullied"`
- Returns supportive responses aimed at **comforting the user**, not solving their problems directly.
- Designed for web integration with a responsive chatbot interface and a symbolic logo: a **cartoon brain hugging a heart** üß†‚ù§Ô∏è.

## Intent Recognition Model

The chatbot's intelligence is based on **intent classification**, where emotional user messages are mapped to predefined **intent tags** like:

| Intent Tag                  | Example Message                             |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `i am sad`                 | "I'm feeling really low today"              |
| `relationship-issues`      | "I broke up and can't move on"              |
| `i hate myself`            | "I don‚Äôt think I deserve to be here"        |
| `gratitude`                | "Thank you for always listening"            |
| `i want to quit`           | "I want to disappear"                       |
| `i am a victim of bullying`| "They harass me every day at school"        |

Each tag is associated with varied **patterns** and **empathetic response templates**.
